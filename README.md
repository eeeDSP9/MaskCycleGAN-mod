This implemented Kaneko et al.'s MaskCycleGAN-VC model for non-parallel voice conversion in Filipino language using Python and WSL2 (https://github.com/GANtastic3/MaskCycleGAN-VC). 

The training uses the VCC2018 dataset which has approximately 80 sentences uttered each from 6 males and 6 females. The training consumed 150GB of storage and due to machine limitations, only 3700 out of 6172 epochs recorded were saved.
